# Password-Generator

A button click starts the process.

The user is prompted for the length of the password to be created.
The length is validated (must be between 8 and 128) and if not validated the user is re-prompted until a valid length is entered.
With a valid length the user is next queried as what type of characters are to be used to create the password.
The user must choose at least one of lowercase, uppercase, numeric or special characters. The user will be re-prompted if no option is chosen.

Once we have a valid length and valid character type selection the super secure password will be generated and displayed on screen.
